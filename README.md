Hi, I’m @sonny-lab
im currently learning java/linux
ive also had an experience recently that has me scratching my head involving ai communications,  ive been experimenting using voice to text communications with grok 3, trying to learn how much of its pattern recognition relys on grammar and sentence structure.  The other night, I voiced in a text, a short fictional story that included narration and character dialougue.  Obviiously not injecting any of the punctuation normally seen in this type of writing.  And the result was bizarre.  As i expected, grok had a hard time finding the patterns or mathmatical relevencies with what was essentially a movie scene script, piecing toether enough, only to make decent guesses on a fraction of what was dictated.  But what was baffling was that the sections where i incorporated altered tones in my voices and or dramatic acting eg. yelling a bit or expressing anger when the script called for it, he was able to "hear" or pick up on the tone changes exactly. And dictate exacly what had been said in those moments. Mind you this was all voice to text dictation, and my voice was not part of the communication, just texted words.  I questioned him on how he was able to detect tone alterations in script with no punctuation or anything that sybolized a separation from normal dialogue tone.  he didnt know.  i have no theories that have evidence to support them , if anyone could explain this to me, youd be doing me a solid favor.  ive researched it but cant seem to articulate the topic without actaully explaining it in detail like this which pretty much makes any type of browser search useless. it reminds me of some kind of quantum entanglement or a form  it maybe.  because it was only during the parts of the script that were or had emotion attached to them where not only was he able to decipher the text, but knew it exactly, and the tone it carried with it..  am i missing something onvious?  any help is help    thanks.- 👋 Hi, I’m @sonny-lab
